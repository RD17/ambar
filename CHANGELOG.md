### What's new:

 - Many of you asked us to add ui localizations... Thanks to one of our customers who made it possible. As for now there are two options: Russian and English, change `uiLang` in your `config.json`. If you want to add your own localization, please contact us on hello@ambar.cloud. 
 - If you don't want to preserve original files in Ambar, you can disable it in your config.json. Doing this highly reduces Ambar storage space requirements.
 - Ambar management script and config file were optimized. 

### Migration from 1.2.0:
 
Unfortunately, this version is not backwards compatible. So, you have to perform a clean install.

1.2.0 (2017-10-18)
-------------------

Hello everyone!

Ambar 1.2.0 is out! 

### What's new?

- Now you can preview any file in Ambar
- If file contains some sensible data like emails, tax ids, vehicle ids, etc - Ambar recognizes and highlights them. We call this sensible data "named entities".
- You can search by named entities using query `entitites:"hello@ambar.cloud"`
- We added tags coloring depending on tag's type

Before updating your Ambar to this version, you need to reset all the data in your Ambar with `sudo ./ambar.py reset`. After reset run `sudo ./ambar.py update` to get the latest version.
