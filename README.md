## FAQ
### Is it open-source?
Yes, it's fully open-source now.

### Is it free?
Yes, it is forever free.

### Does it perform OCR? 
Yes, it performs OCR on images (jpg, tiff, bmp, etc) and PDF's. OCR is perfomed by well-known open-source library Tesseract. We tuned it to achieve best perfomance and quality on scanned documents. You can easily find all files on which OCR was perfomed with `tags:ocr` query

### Which languages are supported for OCR?
Supported languages: Eng, Rus, Ita, Deu, Fra, Spa, Pl, Nld.
If you miss your language please contact us on hello@ambar.cloud.

### Does it support tagging?
Yes!

### What about searching in PDF?
Yes, it can search through any PDF, even badly encoded or with scans inside. We did our best to make search over any kind of pdf document smooth.

### What is the maximum file size it can handle?
It's limited by amount of RAM on your machine, typically it's 500MB. It's an awesome result, as typical document managment systems offer 30MB maximum file size to be processed.  

### I have a problem what should I do?
